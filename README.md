## Enigma

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a critical situation that has arisen from our recent intelligence operations. Last night, we intercepted a suspicious communication from enemy forces that contains potentially vital information regarding an imminent operation.

The contents of the intercepted message suggest that the enemy is mobilizing for a significant tactical move. Phrases indicate both a specific target and details about the objectiveâ€™s timing and location, all of which are essential for our operational planning and countermeasures.

However, this communication appears to have been encoded using the Enigma M3 model. It is imperative that we deduce the correct configuration of this machine to decrypt the message and ascertain the necessary details that may give us a strategic advantage.

You are asked to solve the puzzles of this number of Pardazeh Journal to find configurations of the Enigma M3 machine in the middle or at the end of them. (Or you can easily experience brute force...)

The only way to ensure the authenticity of a decoded letter is that It ends with "Heil Hitler!". 

Good luck!
